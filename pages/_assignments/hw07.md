> ## Update
> If you only want to run the tests pertinent to Homework 7, use this new <a href="https://github.com/csci344/spring2023/blob/main/course-files/homework/hw07/tests/run_tests_hw07.py" target="_blank">run_tests_hw07.py</a> testing file, which you will need to save and run from the `tests` directory (and make sure your python virtual environment is activated).

{:#part1}
## I. Introduction
For homework 7 & 8, you are going to create a REST API using Flask and PostgreSQL. To do this, you will:

{:.compact}
1. Create and populate a local database
2. Configure your python code to interact with the database using SQL Alchemy
3. Use Flask RESTful to implement a few API endpoints
4. Run the tests to see that your API requirements have been met
5. Deploy your code to Heroku (recommended but optional)


{:#part2}
## II. Setting Everything Up
Before you get into the concepts and code, let's first download and configure the hw07 files. Please complete the following steps:

### 1. Download the HW7 files and save them inside of your csci344 folder
Download hw07.zip and unzip it. 

<a class="nu-button" href="/spring2023/course-files/homework/hw07.zip">hw07.zip<i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

You should see a directory structure that looks like this:

```shell
hw07
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── Procfile
├── README.md
├── app.py
├── fake_data.py

```
{:#venv}
### 2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies

Navigate to the `hw07` folder on your command line. Then create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

#### For Mac, Unix, Linux
```bash
# creates the virtual environment
python3 -m venv env 

# activates your virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# install any new Python dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

#### For Windows Powershell or Command Prompt

```bash
# creates the virtual environment
py -m venv env 

# run the activate.bat script as follows:
env\Scripts\activate

# install any new Python dependencies
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a new database and populate it
#### 1. Create a new database 
Create a new database called `photo-app`. In Sarah's opinion, the easiest way to do this is via the command line:

{:.compact}
* Type: `psql -U postgres`
* From within the psql shell, type: `CREATE DATABASE "photo-app";`
* Type: `\q` to exit the shell 

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> If `psql` is not recognized on your command line, see the Tutorial 10 instructions for configuring your path.

#### 2. Add DB_URL to your .env file
Create an environment variable called `DB_URL` in your `.env` file. This variable will store the path to your database in a format that SQLAlchemy can understand. Your database connection information is represented as follows...

`postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{database}`

Each parameter of the connection string is described in the table below:

| **user** | The database user (`postgres` for now) |
| **password** | The password associated with the database user (which you set in Lab 3). Please make sure that your postgres password does not have the "@" symbol. If it does, please reset it as follows (from the command line):<br>`psql -U postgres`<br>`postgres=# ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';` |
| **host** | The address of the computer where your database is stored. For now, it will be `localhost` (since it's stored on your local computer). When we set up your database using Heroku Postgres, your host will be in the cloud. |
| **database** | The name of the database to which you want ot connect (`photo-app`) |

Here is Sarah's `.env` file (your postgres password will be different):

```bash
FLASK_APP=app.py
# postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{database}
DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:12345@localhost/photo-app
```

> **NOTE**: If you configured your postgres to work on a port other than 5432 (only a few students have had to do this), you will also have to specify the alternative port in your connection string as follows:
>
> * `postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{database}`
> * Example: `postgresql://postgres:12345@localhost:5433/photo-app`

#### 3. Populate your database
When you're done, populate your database by running the following command on the command line (from the `photo-app` directory): 

```bash
# run from within the photo-app directory on the command line (with your venv activated):
python populate.py
```

Each time the `populate.py` script is run, it will delete all of the tables and recreate them with some fake data using the SQL Alchemy library. Feel free to take a look at how this script works if you're curious! As you're testing, feel free to run the `populate.py` script to get a fresh copy of your database.

### 4. Verify Your Installation
To verify your installation...

#### 1. Run Flask
Run flask with your virtual environment activated:

```shell
flask run --debug
```

You should see output that looks similar to this:

```shell
 * Serving Flask app 'app.py' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 802-745-136
```

#### 2. Verify that the API Tester Loads
Next, navigate to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/api" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:5000/api</a> and you should see a screen that looks like this:

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/api_tester.png" />

This UI can help you test your API (as can the automated tests and Postman).

#### 3. Run the automated test suite
From a new terminal / shell window, navigate into the `hw07/tests` and run the test suite **while Flask is running**. In other words, you will have 2 terminals open: one that's running flask and one that's for the test suite:

<img class="small frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/shell-run-flask.png" />

<img class="small frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/shell-run-tests.png" />


```shell
cd tests
python run_tests.py 
```

The test suite should run 62 tests. You should see a bunch of error messages output to the screen with a summary at the bottom telling you that there were 43 failures and 12 errors.

```shell
FFFFFEEEFF.FEFFFFFEFF.FFEFFFFFEFFFFFEF.FFF.FFFF.FFFFF.E.FFEFEF


A bunch of error messages....


Ran 62 tests in 1.230s
FAILED (failures=44, errors=11)
```


{:#part3}
## III. Background Readings and Concepts
Before you start coding, let's spend a few minutes reviewing some of the libraries and principles that we'll be using for this assignment. Specifically:

{:.compact}
1. [SQL Alchemy](#sqlalchemy)
2. [Flask RESTful](#flaskrestfulintro)
3. [Heroku](#herokuintro) (optional)


{:#sqlalchemy}
### 1. SQL Alchemy
Please see the [SQL Alchemy](../activities/intro-sql-alchemy) activity (to be done in class) to get guidance re: how to interact with the database. There are many examples in the activity that are directly related to completing your homework. We will spend an entire class period going over it.


{:#flaskrestfulintro}
### 2. Flask RESTful
Now that you've had some practice interacting with your database using SQL Alchemy, you're ready to create some REST API endpoints. As a reminder, REST is an architectural style that allows other clients to interact with some subset of your database over the web (using HTTP). To help us build these endpoints and keep them organized, we're going to use a convenience library called <a href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Flask RESTful</a>. You can learn more about this library by reading the documentation. 

You will be using the `Resource` class from Flask RESTful to build our various endpoints. I have already created a bunch of starter endpoints for you in the `views` directory that you will be editing for this assignment. Note that each file in the `views` directory has a `List` and `Detail` resource defined:

{:.compact}
* The `List` resource is for returning lists of resources and creating new resources.
* The `Detail` resource is for reading, updating, and deleting individual resources.

#### Examine the views/posts.py file
Open the `views/posts.py` file so that you can take a look at the code for creating, reading, updating, and deleting `Post` models.

* The `PostListEndpoint` class in `views/posts.py` is in charge of getting a list of posts (GET) and creating a new posts (POST). It is accessible with this endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/posts/.
* The `PostDetailEndpoint` class in `views/posts.py` is in charge of getting individual posts (GET), updating a post (PATCH), and deleting a post (DELETE). It is accessible with this endpoint:  http://localhost:5000/api/posts/&lt;id&gt; (but replace &lt;id&gt; with a valid Post id).

#### Verify the Postman can interact with your various endpoints
When you're done inspecting this file, please open Postman to test one of the `Post` endpoints. You will have to download "Postman Agent" in order for Postman to be able to access endpoints on your local computer.


{:.compact}
1. Paste http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/posts/ into the address bar
2. Ensure that the GET method is selected
3. Click the "Send" button. 

If it worked, you will see an **empty list** `[]` in the output panel. This is because the `/api/posts/` endpoint for the GET method has not yet been implemented:

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/postman-before.png" />


{:#herokuintro}
### 3. Heroku (optional)
You have the option of using Heroku to deploy your photo-app to a live server. <a href="https://www.heroku.com/about" target="_blank">Heroku</a> "is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps." This means that you can configure a virtual computer on someone else's machine, and then save and run your files there. The basic process is as follows:
1. You create a new app (i.e. container)
1. You create a few different configuration files that tell your Heroku instance what software packages to install (e.g. Flask, SQL Alchemy, etc.). Specifically, we've created:
    * `requirements.txt` to install python packages
    * A `Procfile` to tell Heroku that we want to run a Flask web server using <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-gunicorn" target="_blank">Gunicorn</a>
1. You set some environment variables that tell Heroku how to access your database.
1. You will download and configure the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI), and use git to push your branch to Heroku.
1. And finally, you deploy.

Heroku also has support for hosting PostgreSQL databases, which is a free service if you register as a student. Also, if you have the free version, it goes to sleep if it hasn't been used for a while. So the first time you access your Heroku website, it's a little slow.

{:#part4}
## IV. Requirements

### 1. Resources
The API should make 8 resources available to Photo App. Note that the `to_dict()` methods in each Model definition should **already generate the data structures shown below.** This section just describes what these resources look like:

1. [Post](#post)
1. [User](#user)
1. [Comment](#comment)
1. [Bookmark](#bookmark)
1. [LikePost](#likepost)
1. [Following](#following)
1. [Follower](#follower)
1. [Story](#story)
{:compact}

{:#post}
#### 1. Post
Post resources should contain data about the **post**, the **user**, and any associated **comments** (order within the json object doesn't matter). It should also contain some convenience data fields such as whether the current user has liked or bookmarked the post (e.g. **current_user_like_id** and **current_user_bookmark_id**). The `to_dict()` method in each of the models already does this for you, so you will invoke the model's to_dict() method when returning resources.

        }
    }
}
```

{:#likepost}
#### 5. LikePost
The LikePost resource should be structured like this:

```json
{
    "id": 662,
    "user_id": 12,
    "post_id": 3
}
```

{:#following}
#### 6. Following
The Following resource should just be an id and a user object structured like this:
```json
{
    "id": 302,
    "following": {
        "id": 11,
        "first_name": "Ashley",
        "last_name": "Thornton",
        "username": "ashley_thornton",
        "email": "ashley_thornton@hotmail.com",
        "image_url": "https://picsum.photos/300/200?id=939",
        "thumb_url": "https://picsum.photos/30/30?id=465"
    }
}
```

{:#follower}
#### 7. Follower
The Follower resource (which is created using the "Following" model)resource should just be an id and a user object structured like this:
```json
{
    "id": 302,
    "follower": {
        "id": 11,
        "first_name": "Ashley",
        "last_name": "Thornton",
        "username": "ashley_thornton",
        "email": "ashley_thornton@hotmail.com",
        "image_url": "https://picsum.photos/300/200?id=939",

    }
}
```

{:#story}
#### 8. Story
The Story resource should be structured like this (mostly just a placeholder for now):
```json
{
    "id": 7,
    "text": "Produce Democrat what city professor young though since southern history deep mother.",
    "user": {
        "id": 11,
        "first_name": "Lindsey",
        "last_name": "Shepard",
        "username": "lindsey_shepard",
        "email": "lindsey_shepard@gmail.com",
        "image_url": "https://picsum.photos/300/200?id=159",
        "thumb_url": "https://picsum.photos/30/30?id=689"
    }
}
```

### 2. Security
Access to data is contextual, based on the user who is logged into the system. For now, the person logged into the system is represented by the `current_user` variable, which is set in `app.py`.

> #### Who is currently logged in?
> The current user is hardcoded as user_id=12

#### Read Permissions
Our photo sharing app is more private than Instagram, and the rules are simple:

{:.compact}
* The user can only see their own posts and stories, and the posts and stories (and associated comments) of people they're following. 
* The user can only see their own bookmarks, followers, and who is following them (this is private information).

#### Write Permissions

{:.compact}
* The user can only bookmark, like, and comment on their own posts and the posts of people they're following.
* The user can only edit and delete comments, posts, and stories that they created themselves.

### 3. HTTP Status Codes
All HTTP responses have an attached status code, which represents additional information about the request. A list of all valid HTTP status codes can be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" target="_blank">here</a>. For this assignment:

{:.compact}
* All routes should return a 200 status code for a valid request unless POST is used, in which case a 201 status should be used. 
* If a requests asks for information about data that does not exist (e.g. retrieving a Post with an id that isn’t present in the data), a 404 code should be used.
* If the user sent a request that is invalid, a 400 code should be used.

### [HW8] Implement POST, PATCH, and DELETE routes (20 points)
The next set of routes involves storing and manipulating data in your PostgreSQL. A few notes:

{:.compact}
* PATCH and DELETE methods can fail to find an object if it does not exist within data or if the current user does not have access to it. In these cases, you should mark the status of the response as 404, indicating that the requested resource could not be found.
* Receiving two POST requests with identical bodies should create two different objects with distinct ids.
* PostgreSQL will create ids for you automatically.

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Method/Route</th>

### [Extra Credit] Publish your REST API (10pts)
When you're done, you will publish your website to Heroku. Even if you are collaborating with a partner, both of you will need to deploy your own website.

<!-- > #### Video
> Here is a <a href="https://northwestern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8c044a55-38fd-44d0-8a4e-ae84017fb836" target="_blank">video walkthrough</a> of the deployment process if it helps! -->

#### 1. Create a Heroku App
Register for Heroku (if you don't yet have an account): <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/" target="_blank">https://signup.heroku.com/</a>.

Create a new app on Heroku by logging into the Heroku website and using the Web UI. Name it anything you want!

<img class="frame xsmall" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku1.png" />

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku2.png" />

#### 2. Create a Hosted Database 
After creating your app, you will create a database using <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql" target="_blank">Heroku Postgres</a>. Click the "Install Heroku Postgres" button (purple).
* You will have to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/students" target="_blank">register with Heroku as a student</a> to get this database for free. 

<img class="small frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku6a.png" />

Next, search for the app you just made and then click "Submit Order Form"

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku6b.png" />

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku7.png" />

When you're done, you should see a confirmation screen:

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku8.png" />

#### 3. Add Database Environment Variables

Now navigate to the "Settings" tab:

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku9.png" />

Scroll down and click the "Reveal Config Vars"

<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku10.png" />

You should notice that Heroku Postgres has created a database connection string for you in the format: 

```shell
postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:5432/<database_name>
```

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku11.png" />

You are going to create a new environment variable called `DB_URL` that is identical to the `DATABASE_URL` string, but prefixed by `postgresql://` instead of `postgres://` (which is necessary to work with SQL Alchemy).

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw07/heroku12.png" />

Copy that environment variable to your `.env` file and comment out the DB_URL environment variable pointing to your local database instance:

```bash
DEBUG=True
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_APP=app.py

# Comment out local database string:
# DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:12345@localhost/photo-app

# Add cloud database string:
DB_URL=postgresql://vqwckqdllbhfsj:<some_password>@ec2-34-205-209-14.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dbintgo7m2v4vl

```

Then, on your command line from the root of your `hw07` directory, run the populate.py command again:

```bash
python populate.py
```

This will load some fake data into your cloud database. Because you're inserting ~800 records, this process may take a few minutes.

#### 4. Deploy your app
Finally, you are ready to deploy your app to Heroku via the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI). Note that the GitHub integration is broken.

1. <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up" target="_blank">Download and install the Heroku CLI for your OS</a>.
1. Navigate to your `hw07` folder (using the command line)
1. Log into your Heroku account using the command line interface (CLI), where you will be prompted for a password:<br>`heroku login`
1. Connect your local git repo to your newly created Heroku app (you will only have to do this once):<br>`heroku git:remote -a name-of-the-app-you-just-made`
1. Push your repo to Heroku: `git push heroku main`. 
    * Read more on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25834500/push-different-branch-to-heroku" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>.
1. Test your web server.
1. Don't forget to also push your repo to GitHub `git push origin main`
