## Introduction
Today we will be making sure that everyone understands how to complete [HW5](hw05). The general process for completing all of the HW5 event handlers is:

1. Attach an event handler to the appropriate control.
1. Issue the appropriate HTTP request (POST or DELETE) to modify the relevant resource on the server.
1. **[If Applicable]** Re-query the API for any relevant state changes (e.g., if you add / remove a `Like`, `Bookmark`, or `Comment` resource, the data structure of the `Post` resource will change).
1. Redraw a section of the screen to reflect the state change.

### Endpoints 
To understand how to interact with the API, please see the Photo App API tester: <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/api" target="_blank">https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/api</a>. Below, I have listed the relevant endpoints with which you will have to interact:


| Resource | Endpoint | Methods | Job | Notes |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Bookmark** (Today) | `/api/bookmarks/` | POST | Creates a `Bookmark` resource | Modifies state of corresponding Post |
|  | `/api/bookmarks/<id>` | DELETE | DELETES a `Bookmark` resource  | Modifies state of corresponding Post |
| **Like** | `/api/posts/likes/` | POST | Creates a `Like` resource | Modifies state of corresponding Post |
|  | `/api/posts/likes/<id>` | DELETE | DELETES a `Like` resource | Modifies state of corresponding Post |
| **Comment** | `/api/comments/` | POST | Creates a `Comment` resource | Modifies state of corresponding Post |
|  | `/api/comments/<id>` | DELETE | DELETES a `Comment` resource | Modifies state of corresponding Post |
| **Following** | `/api/following/` | POST | Creates a new `Following` resource  |  |
|  | `/api/following/<id>` | DELETE | Deletes a new `Following` resource  |  |
| **Post** | `/api/posts/<id>` | GET | Retrieves a single `Post` resource  | For re-querying a single Post |


### Two design patterns to be aware of...

There are two "design patterns" for implementing the event handlers: (1) one for bookmarking, liking, and commenting, and (2) one for following / unfollowing users.

#### 1. Bookmarking, Liking, and Commenting
If you create / delete a `Bookmark`, `Like`, or `Comment` resource, ***the structure of the `Post` resource also changes***. This is because a `Post` includes (for convenience) information about comments, likes, and whether the current user has liked or bookmarked the current post (see data structure below): 

```json
{
   "id": 2,
   "image_url": "https://picsum.photos/600/430?id=300",
   "user": {...},
   "caption": "Some Text",
   "alt_text": photo caption,
   "display_time": "14 days ago",
   "likes": [
      {...},
      {...},
      {...}
   ],
   "comments": [
      {...},
      {...},
      {...}
   ],
   "current_user_like_id": 671,
   "current_user_bookmark_id": 566
}
```

Therefore, each event handler (add / remove bookmark, add / remove like, add comment) ought to implement following workflow:

{:.compact}
1. Issue the POST / DELETE Request to the appropriate endpoint.
2. When the response resolves, issue a second GET request to re-query the "Post" resource `/api/posts/<id>` (to get its updated state).
3. When the second response resolves, redraw the modified "Post" by:
    * Invoking the `postToHtml()` function using the updated `Post`, and 
    * Replacing the existing HTML representation of the post (within the DOM) with the new one you just made.
    {:.compact}
4. **Tip:** If the current user has liked / bookmarked a post, you will have to embed the like / bookmark id as a button attribute so that you know what to delete later on.

#### 2. Following / Unfollowing
Creating or deleting a `Following` resource has no bearing on the state of any other resource. As such, the workflow is simpler:

{:.compact}
1. Issue the POST / DELETE Request to the appropriate endpoint.
2. When the response resolves, modify the button to have the right innerHTML (follow / unfollow) and accessibility attributes.
1. **Tip:** Note that if you want the ability to "unfollow" a user after having just created a `Following` resource, you will have to embed the id of the following resource in the element (so you know which resource to delete later on). See animation below:

## Your Task
For today's tutorial we will be implementing the "Bookmark Button" together. Download the starter code and save it in `tutorials/tutorial07`. 

<a href="/spring2023/course-files/tutorials/tutorial07.zip" class="nu-button">Tutorial 7 Starter Files<i class="fas fa-download"></i></a> 

Then, complete the following tasks:

{:.compact}
1. Create a bookmark button that is hollow if the post is not bookmarked and solid if it is (see tips below).
1. When the user clicks the button...
    * If the post **has not** been bookmarked by the current user, issue a `POST` request to the `/api/bookmarks` endpoint (which will create a new Bookmark resource documenting that the current user has bookmarked the post).
    * If the post  **has** been bookmarked by the current user, issue a `DELETE` request to the `/api/bookmarks/<id>` endpoint (which will delete the Bookmark resource).
1. After the bookmark has been created or deleted, requery for the post by issuing a `GET` request to the `/api/posts/<id>` endpoint.
1. Redraw the post.
1. If time, implement the accessibility features.


## Tips

### Bookmark Icons

```html
<!-- solid bookmark -->
<i class="fa-solid fa-bookmark"></i>

<!-- hollow bookmark -->
<i class="fa-regular fa-bookmark"></i>
```

### Example of Using POST Method: Bookmark
```js
const createBookmark = async () => {
    // define the endpoint:
    const endpoint = `https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/api/bookmarks/`;
    const postData = {
        "post_id": SOME_ID_GOES_HERE // replace with the actual post ID
    };

    // Create the bookmark:
    const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(postData)
    })
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}
```

### Example of Using DELETE Method: Bookmark
```js
const deleteBookmark = async () => {
    // define the endpoint:
    const endpoint = `https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/api/bookmarks/<bookmark_id>`;

    // Create the bookmark:
    const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
        method: "DELETE",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
        }
    })
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}
```
