## 1. Introduction
In this homework assignment, you are going to lock down your system so that only logged in users can interact with it. This requires the following changes:


1. User Interface Changes: 
    * Create a login form to handle authentication via JWT cookies.
2. REST API Changes:
    * Implement two new API endpoints (`/api/token` and `/api/token/refresh`) so that third-party clients can also access your REST API.
3. Authentication Changes
    * Deprecate the hard-coded session variable for user #12 and replace it with code that retrieves the user if from the JWT.
    * Lock down all of your endpoints so that they require a valid JWT.

To do this, we will be using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Please review the [Topic 14](../lectures/topic14) materials for the basic JWT workflow.

### 1. Cookies versus authorization headers
You can pass JWTs between the client and the server in a variety of different ways: through cookies, through custom HTTP headers, through the request body, and/or as query parameters. 

1. **Bearer Tokens**: For HW4-HW6, you created a **third-party app** -- separate from the backend -- to interact with your REST API. To do this, you passed the JWT Bearer token in the HTTP. In this context, you did not need the CSRF token or cookies.
2. **CSRF token and an Server-Only Cookie**: For HW9, you will try a different approach, where your front-end client will be hosted within the same web app as the REST API. This allows you to take advantage of some additional security measures, namely using an http-only JWT **cookie**, and incorporating a CSRF token in the HTTP header.

#### 1.1. The http-only JWT Cookie Approach (for Browser-Based Interactions)
1. Your Flask UI will rely on JWT cookies. You will write code to generate these cookies on the server. Subsequently, these cookies will sent back and forth between the browser and the server via request and response headers (respectively). 
2. The `flask-jwt-extended` library has a few convenience functions that will help you generate and set these cookies:

    {:.compact}
    * `create_access_token()` -- generates the token
    * `set_access_cookies()` -- sets the access cookies on the response header
3. Workflow:

    {:.compact}
    1. User sends username and password to the server via a login form.
    1. If the credentials are valid, the server sets the JWT tokens using cookies.
    1. Because the JWT cookies are set, the system will know who is logged in.
        * Web applications will also pass an `X-CSRF-TOKEN` as an extra security measure (see below).
    1. When the JWT access token expires, the system redirects the user to the login screen.

For internal clients that use your REST API, you need to embed something called an `X-CSRF-TOKEN` in the header of your fetch requests. Here is an example of how you might use fetch to access a protected REST Endpoint from within your UI (like you did in HW4-HW6):

```js
fetch("/api/posts", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-TOKEN': '5c4f034d-13d6-4aa2-b686-ee0add18426b'
        }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    });
```

That said, 

#### 1.2. The Authorization Bearer Approach (for Third-Party Clients)

For external clients, you need to offer them another way to access your REST API without actually having to log into your UI. To do this, you will implement:

{:.compact}
* A way for a user to authenticate with the REST API order to receive an access and refresh token.
* Security measures on all of your REST API endpoints that require an access token.

Here is an example of how you might use fetch to access a protected resource from an ***external*** python app, using a Bearer token:

For JavaScript clients that issue requests from other servers (not one that you own):
```js
fetch("/api/posts", {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token
        }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    });
```

For Python clients:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:5000/api/posts',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_token
    }
)
print('Status Code:', response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```


### 2. The Flask-JWT-Extended Library
To help you implement the JWT workflow, you will be using the `flask-jwt-extended` library, which offers some common JSON Web Token functionality that will help you. Please refer to the full documentation to get a more comprehensive explanation. Some links that we have found to be particularly helpful:

{:.compact}
* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/#general-options" target="_blank">Configuration options</a>
* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#verify-tokens-in-request" target="_blank">Verification & helper functionality</a>
* <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refreshing_tokens/" target="_blank">Refreshing tokens</a>

<!-- 
#### Cheatsheet
Below are some key pieces of functionality that will be important to you as you implement authentication:

{:.cheatsheet}
| Description | Code | Notes |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Configuration** | |  | |
| Access Token Expiration | `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES` | defaults to 10 minutes |
| Refresh Token Expiration | `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES`| defaults to 30 days
| Secret (Salt for encryption algo) | `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | store in your .env file, not in your codebase |
| **Methods & Properties** | | | |
| Current User | `flask_jwt_extended.current_user` | property that stores a User object of the logged in user. Only works if you configure your "user_lookup_loader" (see below)|
| |  | |
| **Decorators** | | | |
| Current User function decorator | `@jwt.user_lookup_loader` | Decorator to be used to specify how the current user should be retrieved (given the identity info embedded in the token). |
 -->

## 2. Setup
Download hw09.zip and unzip it. 

<a class="nu-button" href="/spring2022/course-files/homework/hw05.zip">hw05.zip<i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

You should see a directory structure that looks like this:

```bash
hw09
├── decorators.py
├── models
│   └── api_structure.py
├── requirements.txt
├── static
├── templates
├── tests_updated
└── views
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── authentication.py
    └── token.py
```

Please integrate the starter files **VERY CAREFULLY** (don't rush) as follows:

### 1. Add (new files)

| File / Folder | What is this file? |
|--|--|
| `decorators.py` | Added a [decorator](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) whose job is to redirect to the login page if no credentials are found. |
| `tests_updated` (entire folder) | Updated tests that incorporate authentication. |
| `views/authentication.py` | View that handles the login / logout form functionality. |
| `views/token.py` | API Endpoint that issues access / refresh token if authorized credentials are provided. |


### 2. Replace

| File / Folder | What Changed? |
|--|--|
| `models/api_structure.py` | New routes (`/login`, `/logout`, `/api/token`, and `/api/token/refresh`) added to the tester. |
| `requirements.txt` | Added new library / dependency called `Flask-JWT-Extended` |
| `static` (entire folder) | A few new helper JavaScript and CSS files. |
| `templates` (entire folder) | Now includes sample code for how to make requests with the authentication headers. |
| `views/__init__.py` | `initialize_routes` function updated to include new routes (`/login`, `/logout`, `/api/token`, and `/api/token/refresh`). |

### 3. Modify app.py

Add the following lines to `app.py`

Add the new import statements:
```py
# import statement at the top
import flask_jwt_extended   
from flask_multistatic import MultiStaticFlask as Flask
from flask import send_from_directory                     
```

Replace CORS statement:
```py
# replace CORS statement with this one:
# update:
cors = CORS(app, 
    resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": '*'}}, 
    supports_credentials=True # new
)
```

Tell flask which static folders it needs to be aware of:
```py
# 3. place the following after: app = Flask(__name__)
app.static_folder = [
    os.path.join(app.root_path, 'react-client', 'build', 'static'),
    os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static')
]
```

Turn on the JWT Manager:
```py
# 4. Turn on the JWT Manager
app.config['PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS'] = True 
jwt = flask_jwt_extended.JWTManager(app)
```

Add the JWT user lookup convenience function (<a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automatic_user_loading/" target="_blank">https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automatic_user_loading/</a>)

```py
# 5. Include JWT starter code for querying the DB for user info:
@jwt.user_lookup_loader
def user_lookup_callback(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
    # print('JWT data:', jwt_data)
    user_id = jwt_data["sub"]
    return User.query.filter_by(id=user_id).one_or_none()
```

Modify the root path to point to your React App:
```py
# 6. modify the root path to point to your React App:
@app.route('/')
@decorators.jwt_or_login
def home():
    # https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-a-react-python-flask-project-on-heroku-edb99309311
    return send_from_directory(app.root_path + '/react-client/build', 'index.html')
```

### 4. Integrate Your React Client
1. Copy your react client folder (from HW6) into the root of your Flask app. Rename that folder to `react-client` (you can call it anything, but let's keep it consistent for simplicity).

#### Heroku Instructions (for extra credit)
If you plan to deploy your app to Heroku, there are a few additional steps you need to complete:
* Create a `package.json` file at the root of your Flask app (note that this is in addition to the `package.json` file inside of your `react-client` directory) that has the JSON format shown below.
* The second `package.json` file at the root of your app teaches Heroku to compile your react app from within the `react-client` subdirectory.
* Ensure that your `react-client/node_modules` and `react-client/build` folders are excluded from git via your `.gitignore` file. If you don't know how to do this, ask Sarah.
* Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
* Deploy to Heroku (see instructions below).

**package.json file at the root of your Flask app** (not the one in your `react-client` folder):
```json
{
    "name": "photo-app-heroku-react-build-file",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "scripts": {
      "build": "cd react-client && npm install && npm run build"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "cross-env": "^7.0.3"
    }
}  
```


### 5. Install dependencies:
On the command line / Terminal / shell, activate your virtual environment. Then, install the new `Flask-JWT-Extended` dependency as follows:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`


### 6. Create a new environment variable
In your `.env` file, add a new environment variable for your JWT secret. You can make this secret anything you want:

`JWT_SECRET=MY_SECRET`

### 7. Run your old tests
Run your old tests (in the `tests` directory). They should all still pass). By the end of the assignment, all of the new tests (in the `tests_updated` directory) should pass.


## 3. Your Tasks
For this assignment, you will be implementing an authentication system for your REST API and for your app. There are 4 tasks you need to complete:

{:#deprecate}
### 2. Deprecating User #12 (4 Points)

Now that you've implemented a way for your user to log, you need display the logged in user's data. However, the way the application is currently configured, you're still displaying User #12. To fix this, you will need to deprecate `app.current_user`, which relies on the following code in `app.py`

```python
# set logged in user
with app.app_context():
    app.current_user = User.query.filter_by(id=12).one()
```

Luckily, the `flask-jwt-extended` library provides a way to do this. The approach:
1. Define a function that retrieves the User object based on the user_id that is embedded in the token.
2. Add the `@jwt.user_lookup_loader` decorator to the top of the function. By doing this, you can use the built-in `flask-jwt-extended.current_user` property to access the logged in user (works like magic).

**Sample code:**

First, define a function for retrieving a user from the database using the embedded JWT user_id:

```python
# defines the function for retrieving a user from the database
@jwt.user_lookup_loader
def user_lookup_callback(_jwt_header, jwt_data):
    # print('JWT data:', jwt_data)
    # https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/automatic_user_loading/
    user_id = jwt_data["sub"]
    return User.query.filter_by(id=user_id).one_or_none()
```

When you're done, replace ALL instances of `app.current_user` with `flask_jwt_extended.current_user`. 

{:#rest}
### 3. Securing the REST API (15 Points)
You will make the following changes to your REST API in order to implement JWT authentication:

{:.compact}
1. Create an endpoint to issue a access / refresh token.
2. Create an endpoint to issue a new access token (using your refresh token).
3. Lock down all of your endpoints.

* When you're done with parts 1-3, all of the tests in `tests_updated` should pass (just run `run_tests.py`).

{:#heroku}
### 4. Deploying to Heroku (1 Point)
Please commit all of your changes / additional files to git. When you’re done, create a NEW Heroku app for your hw09 branch. You will follow the same process as you did for the HW7 Heroku deployment, with two differences:

* Instead of creating a brand new Heroku Postgres database, just use the same DB_URL environment variable that you used in HW7.
* Make sure you push your hw09 branch to Heroku: git push heroku hw09:main
* You will have to create one additional environment variable called `JWT_SECRET`. We recommend that you use the same secret locally and on Heroku. To add an environment variable, go to the settings tab of your app and click the "Reveal Config Vars" button.


## 4. What to Turn In
Please review the requirements above and ensure you have met them. Specifically:

{:.medium}
| Points | Category |
|--|--|
| [15 points](#ui) | User Interface Related Tasks |
| [4 points](#deprecate)  | Deprecate User #12 |
