## 1. Introduction
In this assignment, you will be exploring an alternate strategy for creating front-end interfaces. Specifically, instead of rendering your HTML code on the server-side (using Jinja and Flask), you will be asking your Browser to build your UI for you using JavaScript. Within this design paradigm, the browser will load a very simple HTML "skeleton," and then execute some "client-side" JavaScript (that you will write) to build the DOM. 

You will also be implementing some event handlers to interact with the REST API that you made -- in order to like, bookmark, and comment on posts; and to follow new users. And finally, you'll continue your work to ensure that your interface is accessible.


> <h3 style="margin-bottom:10px">A few notes and guidelines</h3>
> * You will be working on the follow / unfollow functionality during [Lab 7](lab07) this week.
> * You will be working on some of the "post" and "modal" functionality in class during the week of 5/9. Please come to class with your files set up because it will be easier to follow along.
> * HW4 assignment is designed to take approximately 5-10 hours (depending on your level of experience). We encourage you to do a little at a time during class and in lab, so that you have enough time to engage with the concepts and complete the exercises without intense stress at the end.
> * You may NOT use any outside CSS or JavaScript libraries (other than Font Awesome). Everything should be done by writing your own "vanilla" HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 2. Set Up

### Create a New Branch
1. On your terminal or command line, navigate to your photo-app folder.
1. Make sure that `hw03` is still your active branch by typing `git branch`. 
1. Next, create a branch called hw05 as follows: `git checkout -b hw05`. Since you created your `hw05` branch from your `hw03` branch, your `hw05` branch should be currently be identical to your `hw03` branch.
1. Type `git branch` to ensure that you are indeed on the `hw05` branch (it should be green with an asterik next to it).
1. Push your hw05 branch to GitHub as follows: `git push -u origin hw05`
1. Open GitHub in your web browser and verify that your hw05 branch is there.

### Register for a new user account on the Course Photo App API
Sarah TODO: Create a way for everyone to register for an account (complete with workflow for resetting password, etc.).

## 3. Your Tasks
{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> ### Working Demo
> If you want to see a working demo of the completed HW4 interface (ignore the login screen), take a look <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> (username: **webdev**, password: **password**)

Please complete the following tasks by making modifications to:

{:.compact}
* `templates/starter-client.html`
* `static/css/starter-client.css`
* `static/js/hw05.js`

You're more than welcome to add more CSS & JS files as needed (though this is not necessary).



{:#init}
### 1. Page Initialization Tasks (8 Points)
The functionality in this section must be invoked when the page first loads (so that the user sees each of these panels right away).

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Figure</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0pts</td>
            <td>Stories Panel</td>
            <td>
                <strong>ALREADY DONE FOR YOU.</strong> Render an HTML representation of stories from the user's network using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/stories</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1pt</td>
            <td>Right Panel: User Profile
            </td>
            <td>
                Inside of the right panel at the top, render an HTML representation of the current user's profile using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/profile</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>Right Panel: Suggested Accounts</td>
            <td>
                Inside of the right panel (underneath the user profile), render an HTML representation of suggested user accounts using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/suggestions</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5pts</td>
            <td>Posts Panel</td>
            <td>
                Underneath the stories panel, renter an HTML representation of the first 10 posts from the user's network using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts</code> endpoint. Please ensure that the following rules are honored:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        (Same as HW2) If there is more than one comment associated with the post, display a “view all n comments” button and the first post below it (replace n by the actual number of comments). Otherwise, display a single comment below the title of the post (if one exists).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already liked the post, the heart icon should be red <i style="color: #cf0c0c" class="fas fa-heart"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-heart"></i>. Consider using the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_like_id</code> attribute included in the post object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already bookmarked the post, the bookmark icon should be black <i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>. Consider using the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_bookmark_id</code> attribute included in the post object.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Note that the content from each box should be generated from the API data (no hard-coding).

{:#post-detail}
### 2. Post Detail Modal (5 Points)
Next, you will make a modal window that displays a more detailed representation of the post.

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                "View all X comments" Button Click
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Modal box opens</li>
                    <li>Close button in top, right-hand corner</li>
                    <li>The rest of the page is blocked behind a panel so that you can't interact with the rest of the page</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Modal Body
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>
                        The featured image is displayed on the and all of the comments on the right (as pictured)
                    </li>
                    <li>All of the comments are displayed</li>
                    <li>The comment box scrolls</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1pt</td>
            <td>
                Close Button Click
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>
                        Clicking the close button will close the modal window
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


<figure>
    <figcaption id="fig5">Figure 5: Post Detail in Modal Box</figcaption>
    <p>Note: in this example, the picture changes because of the way that picsum.photos works. Just ignore that for now.</p>

{:#accessibility}
### 4. Accessibility Features (6 points)
Accessibility can be tricky when you're relying on the fetch API, because a screen reader doesn't always know that content has changed on the page. In addition, you don't want to be over-reliant on the mouse. Please take a look at the [Accessibility Resources](/spring2023/accessibility-reference/), and specifically the resources pertaining to aria roles and attributes.

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Keyboard Navigation
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Ensure that all of the buttons are tabbable</li>
                    <li>Hint: if you use the HTML <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code> element for all of your buttons, you get this functionality for free.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Modal Box (Post Detail)
            </td>
            <td>
                Please ensure that the following accessibility features have been implemented. See <a href="https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2013/02/12/making-an-accessible-dialog-box/" target="_blank">this online resource</a>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>When the modal opens, the close control should have the focus.</li>
                    <li>When the modal closes, the "View all X comments" button that triggered the modal to open should have the focus.</li>
                    <li>When the modal is visible / hidden, ensure that the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute reflects the state of the modal.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the modal has the appropriate role set (<code>role="dialog"</code>)</li>
                    <li>Extra credit (2 points): When the user tabs from within the modal, ensure that the focus does not leave the modal.</li>
                    <li>Extra credit (2 points): make the "Escape" key close the modal (in addition to the close button), and make sure the focus still returns to the "View all X comments" button.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

{:#writeup}
### 5. Accessibility Reflection (3 Points)
1. In a brief reflective response (about 4-8 sentences total), please consider the following questions:
- Why, and to whom, is accessibility important?
- How might you make a site (or app) like Instagram more accessible?
1. What resources did you consult as you implemented the accessibility features? Were there any that you found useful that aren't on the Accessibility Resources page?
1. Reflect on the work that went into making your website accessible. 
  * Was it a lot of additional work? 
  * What was the most challenging part?
  * Do you think that designing for accessibility also improves the usability of the site for all users? Why or why not?

{:#heroku}
### 6. Deploy to Heroku (1 Point)
Please commit all of your changes / additional files to git.
When you're done, create a **NEW** Heroku app for your `hw05` branch. You will follow the same process as you did for the [HW3 Heroku deployment](hw03#webdev_3-publish-your-rest-api-5-points), with two differences:

1. Instead of creating a brand new Heroku Postgres database, just use the same `DB_URL` environment variable that you used in HW3. In other words, your HW3 and HW4 Heroku deployments will share a database.
2. Make sure you push your `hw05` branch to Heroku: `git push heroku hw05:main`

## 4. What to Turn In
Please review the requirements above and ensure you have met them. Specifically:

{:.medium}
| Points | Category |
|--|--|
| [8 points](#init)  | Page initialization |
| [5 points](#post-detail) | post detail modal |
| [6 points](accessibility) | Accessibility features |
| 2 points  | Composition and CSS (the UI looks like the screenshots provided) |


### Moodle Submission
When you're done, please submit the following to Canvas:

{:.checkbox-list}
* A zip file of your code
* A comment that includes the following:
    * A link to your Heroku app
    * Your responses to the accessibility questions
    * The name of your partner (if applicable)
