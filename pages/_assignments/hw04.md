*Collaboration and Code Sharing Policy is the same as [HW 3](hw03)*


## 1. Introduction
In this assignment, you will build a "data-driven" version of the interface you built in HW2 using JavaScript. Specifically, you will:

1. Build a very simple HTML "skeleton," and then write some "client-side" JavaScript to (a) query data from a server (using a REST API) and (b) build DOM elements based on the data returned from the server. 
1. Ensure that your interface is accessible.

As you complete this assignment, you may NOT use any outside CSS or JavaScript libraries (other than Font Awesome). Everything should be done by writing your own "vanilla" HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> ### Working Demo
> If you want to see a working demo of the completed HW4 interface (ignore the login screen), take a look:

> <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/</a> 
> * username: **webdev**
> * password: **password**

> The app may be asleep (because I'm using the cheap version of Heroku), so you may need to wait about 10 seconds for it to load.


## 2. Set Up

### 1. Install git
In order to interact with GitHub, you need to install git. Before you install it, check and make sure it’s not already installed by:

1. Windows: search for the software program "GitBash." If you find it, git is already installed. 
2. Mac:
    1. Opening your Terminal and type the word `git` at the command prompt. 
    2. If you get a message that says "not recognized" or something along those lines, then you need to install it.

If you need to install it, follow these instructions:   <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a>.

### 2. Register for an account on GitHub using your student email
Register for a student GitHub account if you don't have one already: <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/join</a>. Some notes:

1. Please register using your `@unca.edu` account. After Spring Break, you will need to use your student discounts to gain access to some cloud hosting services that you will need for the latter assignments.
2. You will eventually need to sign up for the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">Student Developer Pack</a>

### 3. Tell git who you are
Tell git who you are by running the following commands in GitBash (Windows) or in the Terminal (Mac):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Sarah"
git config --global user.email "my_email@unca.edu"
```

Please use **your name**, and the **UNCA email you used when registering with GitHub**.

> #### Note for Computer Lab Computers
> If you are using a computer lab computer, you will need to complete this step (step 4) each time you use git.

### 4. Open your folder in VS Code

<a href="/spring2023/course-files/homework/hw04.zip" class="nu-button">HW04 Starter Files <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a>

1. Download the starter files and save them somewhere that makes sense
2. Rename the `hw04` folder you just downloaded / unzipped to `photo-app`.
1. Replace the the `index.html` and `styles.css` files in `photo-app` with the onse you made in homework 2 (the ones included in the starter files are just placeholder files).
1. Add the following script tag to the `index.html` file that you made from HW2<br>
`<script src="js/main.js" type="module" defer></script>`
1. Open your `photo-app` folder in VS Code.

Your folder structure should look like this:
```shell
photo-app
├── index.html  # your HW2 file
├── js
│   ├── main.js
│   └── utilities.js
└── styles.css  # your HW 2 file
```

### 5. Initialize your repository and commit your files
Within VS Code, click on the "Branch" icon, and then click the blue "Initialize Repository" button.

<img class="screenshot" style="width:60%;min-width:400px;" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw05/github/step1.png" />

Add a message to the message text box (e.g., "My first commit"), and then click the blue "Commit" button.

<img class="screenshot" style="width:60%;min-width:400px;" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw05/github/step2.png" />

### 6. Create a remote branch and send your files to GitHub
After you've committed your changes, you will publish your branch by clicking the "Publish Branch" button.

<img class="screenshot" style="width:60%;min-width:400px;" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw05/github/step3.png" />

Then, make sure you ask for a **public** repo.

<img class="screenshot" style="width:60%;min-width:400px;" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw05/github/step4.png" />

You may be prompted multiple times to give VS Code permissions to interact with GitHub (and vice versa). Please grant permissions. When you're done, you may see a confirmation screen that suggests that you view your files on GitHub. Click the blue "Open on GitHub" button.

<img class="screenshot" style="width:60%;min-width:400px;" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw05/github/step5.png" />

### 7. Configure GitHub Pages
Navigate to your repository and configure GitHub Pages by:
1. Clicking the settings icon (upper right)
2. Clicking on the Pages link (left menu, scroll down halfway) 
3. Clicking the "None" button below the "Branch" subheading.
4. Selecting either the "master" or "main" branch (depending on how your git was configured).
5. Clicking the "Save" button.

<img class="screenshot" style="width:100%;min-width:400px;" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw05/github/step6.png" />


When you're done, wait about 5 minutes and then refresh the page. You should be given a link to your GitHub pages, which you will be able to preview in your browser. Bookmark the page for your convenience.

## 3. Your Tasks


Please complete the tasks listed below. You're more than welcome to add more CSS & JS files as needed (though this is not necessary).


{:#init}
### 1. Page Initialization Tasks (10 Points)
The functionality in this section must be invoked when the page first loads (so that the user sees each of these panels right away).

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Figure</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1pt</td>
            <td>Right Panel: User Profile
            </td>
            <td>
                Inside of the right panel at the top, render an HTML representation of the current user's profile using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/profile</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>Right Panel: Suggested Accounts</td>
            <td>
                Inside of the right panel (underneath the user profile), render an HTML representation of suggested user accounts using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/suggestions</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>Stories Panel</td>
            <td>
                Render an HTML representation of stories from the user's network using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/stories</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5pts</td>
            <td>Posts Panel</td>
            <td>
                Underneath the stories panel, renter an HTML representation of the first 10 posts from the user's network using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts</code> endpoint. Please ensure that the following rules are honored:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If there is more than one comment associated with the post, display a “view all n comments” button (replace n by the actual number of comments) and only show the most recent comment. Otherwise, display a single comment below the title of the post (if one exists).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already liked the post, the heart icon should be red <i style="color: #cf0c0c" class="fas fa-heart"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-heart"></i>. You can check if the current user has liked the post by checking the post's<code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_like_id</code> data field. If the post has been liked by the current user, then this data field exists. Otherwise, the field is undefined. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already bookmarked the post, the bookmark icon should be black <i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>. You can check if the current user has bookmarked the post by checking the post's<code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_bookmark_id</code> data field. If the post has been bookmarked by the current user, then this data field exists. Otherwise, then the field is undefined. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Note that the content from each box should be generated from the API data (no hard-coding).

{:#post-detail}
### 2. Post Detail Modal (5 Points)
Next, you will make a modal window that displays a more detailed representation of the post.

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                "View all X comments" Button Click
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Modal box opens</li>
                    <li>Close button in top, right-hand corner</li>
                    <li>The rest of the page is blocked behind a panel so that you can't interact with the rest of the page</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Modal Body
            </td>

                    </li>
                    <li>All of the comments are displayed on the right (as pictured)</li>
                    <li>The comment box scrolls while the picture stays anchored
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hint: give the comments container a fixed height and set the `overflow-y` style property to `auto`</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1pt</td>
            <td>
                Close Button Click
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>
                        Clicking the close button will close the modal window

{:#accessibility}
### 4. Accessibility Features (4 points)
Accessibility can be tricky when you're relying on the fetch API, because a screen reader doesn't always know that content has changed on the page. In addition, you don't want to be over-reliant on the mouse. Please take a look at the [Accessibility Resources](/spring2023/accessibility-reference/), and specifically the resources pertaining to aria roles and attributes.

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Keyboard Navigation
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Ensure that all of the buttons are tabbable</li>
                    <li>Hint: if you use the HTML <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code> element for all of your buttons, you get this functionality for free.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>

                Modal Box (Post Detail)
            </td>
            <td>
                Please ensure that the following accessibility features have been implemented. See <a href="https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2013/02/12/making-an-accessible-dialog-box/" target="_blank">this online resource</a>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>When the modal opens, the close control should have the focus.</li>
                    <li>When the modal closes, the "View all X comments" button that triggered the modal to open should have the focus.</li>
                    <li>When the modal is visible / hidden, ensure that the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute reflects the state of the modal.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the modal has the appropriate role set (<code>role="dialog"</code>)</li>
                    <li>Extra credit (2 points): When the user tabs from within the modal, ensure that the focus does not leave the modal.</li>
                    <li>Extra credit (2 points): make the "Escape" key close the modal (in addition to the close button), and make sure the focus still returns to the "View all X comments" button.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
