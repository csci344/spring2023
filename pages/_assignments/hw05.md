## 1. Introduction
In this assignment, you will be enhancing your HW4 interface by implementing some event handlers to interact with a REST API -- in order to "like," bookmark, and comment on posts; and to follow new users. 

## 2. Set Up
Before you begin enhancing your interface, create a branch to "remember" your HW4 version of the code (so that you can easily revert back to it if need be). To do this, navigate to your `photo-app` directory on the command line and type the following:

```shell
git branch    # tells you what branch you're currently on.
git checkout -b hw04   # creates and switches to a new branch 
git push --set-upstream origin hw04  # creates a remote copy of your new branch on GitHub
git checkout main   # switches back to the main branch (your branch may be called master instead of main)
git branch    # should tell you that you're back on the main (or master) branch
```

If you did this correctly, when you navigate to GitHub, you should see two branches -- a `main` branch and a `hw04` branch.

## 3. Your Tasks

### 1. Create / Delete Data with Event Handlers (15 Points)
After implementing the read-only functionality, you will implement functionality that actually updates the data in your system as follows:

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Figure</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Like Post
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When the user clicks the heart of "unliked" post, a POST request is issued to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts/likes/</code> endpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the POST response indicates success, redraw the post to indicate that the post has been liked. Ensure that the number of likes is updated.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

                    <li>
                        When the user clicks the heart of "liked" post, a DELETE request is issued to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts/likes/&lt;id&gt;</code> endpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the DELETE response indicates success, redraw the post to indicate that the post has been unliked. Ensure that the number of likes is updated.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a></td>

                    <li>
                        When the user clicks the bookmark button of "unbookmarked" post, a POST request is issued to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/bookmarks/</code> endpoint.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the POST response indicates success, redraw the post to indicate that the post has been bookmarked.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>If the POST response indicates success, redraw the button to indicate that you are now following the account.</li>

### 2. Accessibility Features (6 points)
Accessibility can be tricky when you're relying on the fetch API, because a screen reader doesn't always know that content has changed on the page. In addition, you don't want to be over-reliant on the mouse. Please take a look at the [Accessibility Resources](/spring2023/accessibility-reference/), and specifically the resources pertaining to aria roles and attributes.

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Keyboard Navigation
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Ensure that all of the buttons are tabbable</li>
                    <li>Ensure that all the event handlers can be triggered using the "spacebar" or "enter / return" keys.</li>
                    <li>Hint: if you use the HTML <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code> element for all of your buttons, you get this functionality for free.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Aria attributes
            </td>
            <td>
                Use the 'aria-label' and 'aria-checked' attributes to indicate to the screen reader whether the following buttons are turned on or off:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Like / Unlike button</li>
                    <li>Bookmark / Unbookmark button</li>
                    <li>Follow / Unfollow button</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

{:#writeup}
### 3. Accessibility Reflection (3 Points)
1. In a brief reflective response (about 4-8 sentences total), please consider the following questions:
- Why, and to whom, is accessibility important?
- How might you make a site (or app) like Instagram more accessible?
1. What resources did you consult as you implemented the accessibility features? Were there any that you found useful that aren't on the Accessibility Resources page?
1. Reflect on the work that went into making your website accessible. 
  * Was it a lot of additional work? 
  * What was the most challenging part?
  * Do you think that designing for accessibility also improves the usability of the site for all users? Why or why not?

{:#heroku}
### 6. Deploy to Heroku (1 Point)
Please commit all of your changes / additional files to git.
When you're done, create a **NEW** Heroku app for your `hw05` branch. You will follow the same process as you did for the [HW3 Heroku deployment](hw03#webdev_3-publish-your-rest-api-5-points), with two differences:

1. Instead of creating a brand new Heroku Postgres database, just use the same `DB_URL` environment variable that you used in HW3. In other words, your HW3 and HW4 Heroku deployments will share a database.
2. Make sure you push your `hw05` branch to Heroku: `git push heroku hw05:main`

## 4. What to Turn In
Please review the requirements above and ensure you have met them. Specifically:

{:.medium}
| Points | Category |
|--|--|
| [15 points](#events)  | POST / DELETE functionality |
| [6 points](accessibility) | Accessibility features |
| [3 points](#writeup) | Accessibility reflection |
| [1 point](#heroku)  | Heroku deployment |
| 2 points  | Composition and CSS (the UI looks like the screenshots provided) |


### Moodle Submission Submission
When you're done, please submit the following to Canvas:

{:.checkbox-list}
* A zip file of your code
* A comment that includes the following:
    * A link to your Heroku app
    * Your responses to the accessibility questions
    * The name of your partner (if applicable)
