## 1. Ground Rules (Please Read Carefully)
Quiz 3 is a mixture of in-class and take-home activities. If you are already satified with your quiz score, **you do not need to take Quiz 3.**
 
### In-Class Exercises
The first part of the quiz will be completed **during your regularly scheduled final exam window.** 

* Section 1 (MWF 12:30-2PM): Monday, 12/5 from 11:30AM-2PM
* Section 2 (MWF 3:30-4:45 PM): Friday, 12/2 from 3:00PM-5:30PM

You may use your notes, pen and paper, and any "cheat sheats" that you want to make. You may not use a computer. 

### Take Home Exercises
For the take-home portion of the quiz, you may begin working on it as soon as it is posted (Friday, 12/02 at 8AM). It is due on **Monday (12/5) at 11:59PM.** No quizzes will be accepted after this time.  For the take home portion of the quiz:

* You **MAY** use the course website, as well as any notes, lecture files, or internet reference materials to complete the quiz.
* You **MAY NOT** discuss the quiz with anyone or collaborate in any way with anyone. This is an individual assessment. 

## 2. Study Resources
To study for the quiz, please review the following:
* Course slides, videos, readings, and sample code.
* <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mXB25SyI29fQJAZzvKZthITJbmSjcBAqJTPrSUo-ZOo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Study Guide</a>
* <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m2GEY24tFEKS-dF_-RdwV9KygkTGIr1gV7zVlabpjG4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Sample Problems</a> (for the in-class, written portion of the quiz).
* [Quiz 2](quiz-02)

Please also become very comfortable with the exercises from [Tutorial 12](../assignments/tutorial12) (for the take-home portion of the quiz).

## 3. Actual Quiz

### A. [40pts] Written Portion (In Class) 
To be administered during your regularly scheduled class time. Open notes, closed computer.

### B. [60pts] Computer-Based Portion (Take Home)
Please download the starter files (below) and complete the 3 sets of tasks described below. Read the instructions that are outlined under each task **very carefully.** You must complete each exercise exactly as the instructions indicate to receive full credit. Otherwise, you will receive partial credit for the parts you correctly completed.

<a href="/spring2023/course-files/quizzes/quiz03.zip" class="nu-button">Quiz 3 Starter Files <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a>

#### 1. [20pts] DOM Manipulation 
Open the `exercise01` folder and add click event handlers to all of the div tags. When a div element is clicked, its background should change color (pick any color you like). When youâ€™re done, your page should look like the demo shown below:


<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz03/exercise01.gif" />


#### 2. [20pts] Functions
Open the `exercise02` folder and create a function called `drawMonster` that draws a picture of a monster as pictured below. The function should have the following parameters defined (in order):
1. `x` (number) -- the x-coordinate of the center of the square(s).
2. `y` (number) -- the y-coordinate of the center of the square(s).
3. `size` (number) -- the width of the larger square. 
4. `color` (number) -- the color of the monster's face.
5. `isSurprised` (boolean) -- whether or not the monster should look surprised

If the argument for `isSurprised` is set to true, a "surprised mouth" should be drawn (smaller). Otherwise, a "regular mouth" should be drawn. When I invoke your function as follows (within the `setup()` function)...


```js
drawMonster(100, 100, 150, '#0bc9cd', false);
drawMonster(300, 200, 75, '#8093f1', true);
drawMonster(100, 325, 100, '#8093f1', false);
drawMonster(250, 375, 125, '#7fb285', true);
drawMonster(550, 200, 250, '#7fb285', false);
```

...the image pictured below should be drawn to the screen:

<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz03/exercise02.png" />

**Implementation suggestions (optional):** 
* Use p5.js's built-in <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect">rect function</a>.
* If you include this statement, `rectMode(CENTER);` the `rect()` function will treat the x- and y-coordinates as the center of the rectangle (instead of as the top left-hand corner). You can read more about rectMode <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rectMode" target="_blank">here</a>. 


#### 3. [20pts] Loops + Conditionals

Open the `exercise03` folder and examine all of the files. Inside of `main.js`, there is a `fetchCourses` function (already built for you) that fetches all of the UNCA course offerings for Spring, 2023: (<a href="https://meteor.unca.edu/registrar/class-schedules/api/v1/courses/2023/spring/">here</a>). Note that by modifying the year or term in the URL string, you can also view course offerings from previous semesters. 

##### Your job
1. Modify the *function body* of the `displayResults(courses)` function so that it outputs to the `#results` element only courses that offered within the **CSCI department.** You may use any kind of loop that you like.
2. Ensure that your HTML snippet displays the following information for each course (using a template literal like we did in `HW5`):
    * Title
    * Instructor
    * Location
    * Days (i.e., which days does the course meet?)
3. Location and Days may be `null`. That's OK for this exercise (though in real life, you'd probably want to output a friendlier message).

<img class="large frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz03/exercise03.png" />

**Hints**
* Loop through the `courses` array.
* If the current course's `Department` property is "CSCI", then insert an HTML representation of the course into the `<div class="results"></div>` container. 
* Partial credit will be given.
* We went over this in Lectures 19-20.
* A sample of the HTML representation of a course is shown below, and also in `exercise03/template.html`:

```html
 <section class="course">
    <h3>NM 101.001: Digital Design Principles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Instructor: Cosette, Ashe</li>
        <li>Location: OWE 305</li>
        <li>Days: MW</li>
    </ul>
</section>
```

## What to Submit
Please doublecheck to make sure you've completed the 3 tasks described above. When you're done:

1. Zip your entire `quiz03` folder that contains a **COMPLETED** version of the tasks. 
    * **DO NOT** accidentally submit the starter files or you will not receive any credit for the quiz. 
2. Upload the `quiz03.zip` you just made to the course Moodle under **Quiz 3.**
