Why did the Internet take off so quickly? Why does it look the way it does? In other words, how does the Internet reflect the same desires, interests, and curiosities (and which ones)? Do the same systems of power that function "offline" function "online"?

## Assigned Readings
1. Watch: Black Mirror (Oct. 21, 2016). <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80104627" target="_blank">Nosedive</a>, Season 3, Episode 1. Netflix.
    * If you don't have Netflix, you can purchase it for $1.99 on Amazon.

## Discussion Questions

### Nosedive
* What is being measured? 
* How is meaning assigned to a score?
* How does the system not only "measure" reality, but also shape it?
* What resources & opportunities does this system mediate?

### Other Societal Questions
* Does the Internet amplify all voices equally?
* Why is privacy such a huge concern for the Web / Internet?
* How does life online shape life offline (and vice versa)?
