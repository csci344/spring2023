## Readings
Before beginning the React assignment -- and definitely before Friday's tutorial -- please complete the following readings. It will take you a few hours, but you won't be able to make progress with React without understanding some of the core React conventions and workflow, including:
* <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn" target="_blank">Quick Start</a>
* <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react" target="_blank">Thinking in React</a>. Make note of the steps:
    * Break the UI into a component hierarchy
    * Build a static version in React 
    * Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state (noting the difference between "props" and "state"
    * Identify where your state should live
    * Adding "inverse data flow"
    {:.compact}
* <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/sharing-state-between-components" target="_blank">Sharing state between components</a>
* <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">Tic Tac Toe</a> (we will process this one in class)
