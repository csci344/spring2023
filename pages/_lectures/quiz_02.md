## 3. Actual Quiz

### A. [40pts] Written Portion (In Class) 
To be administered during your regularly scheduled class time. Open notes, closed computer.
* <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jr08fZM4NRABvS_SE9qA6Y-UALyQQaO0vngnQjD8akk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Quiz 2 Solutions</a>

### B. [60pts] Computer-Based Portion (Take Home)
Please download the starter files (below) and complete the 3 sets of tasks described below. Read the instructions that are outlined under each task **very carefully.** You must complete each exercise exactly as the instructions indicate to receive full credit. Otherwise, you will receive partial credit for the parts you correctly completed.

#### 1. [20pts] DOM Manipulation 
Open the `exercise01` folder and add event handlers to all of the buttons. When a button is clicked, the image tag should display the corresponding animal (see the `images` folder), and there should be a label below the image describing the picture. When you're done, your page should look like the animation shown below:

<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz02/animals.gif" />

#### 2. [20pts] Functions
Open the `exercise02` folder and create a function called `drawElmo` that draws a picture of Elmo. The function should have the following parameters defined (in order):
1. `x` (number) -- the x-coordinate of the center of the circle(s).
2. `y` (number) -- the y-coordinate of the center of the circle(s).
3. `size` (number) -- the diameter of the larger circle. 
4. `color` (number) -- the color of Elmo's face.
5. `hasNose` (boolean) -- whether or not Elmo should have a nose (just default the color to a reddish color).

If the argument for `hasNose` is set to true, a nose is drawn. Otherwise, no nose is drawn. A decent looking nose can be made with the ellipse function...
```js
fill('#db5461');
ellipse(500, 500, 70, 100);  // x, y, width, height (but yours needs to scale)
```

...but of course yours will need to be dynamically positioned / scaled according to the function arguments (just like you've been doing for the past several weeks).

When I invoke your function as follows (within the `setup()` function)...

```js
drawElmo(100, 100, 150, '#0bc9cd', true);   // nose drawn
drawElmo(300, 200, 75, '#0bc9cd', false);   // no nose drawn
drawElmo(100, 325, 100, '#8093f1', false);  // no nose drawn
drawElmo(250, 375, 125, '#7fb285', true);   // nose drawn
drawElmo(550, 200, 250, '#102e4a', true);   // nose drawn
```

...the image pictured below should be drawn to the screen:

<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz02/elmos.png" />


#### 3. [20pts] Loops + Conditionals

Open the `exercise03` folder. Inside of `main.js`, write a program, using any kind of loop you want, that draws all of the pictures to the screen where the `is_favorite` property is set to true. You don't have to worry about formatting (the CSS), so long as following 8 images are displayed:

<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz02/photos.png" />

**Hints**
* Loop through the `photos` array.
* If the current photo's `is_favorite` property is set to true, append an image element (`img` tag) to the `<div class="images"></div>` container.
* Consider using a template literal. 
* Partial credit will be given.

## What to Submit
Please doublecheck to make sure you've completed the 3 tasks described above. When you're done:

1. Zip your entire `quiz02` folder that contains a **COMPLETED** version of the tasks. In other words, don't accidentally submit the starter files or you will not receive any credit for the quiz.
2. Upload the `quiz02.zip` you just made to the course Moodle under **Quiz 2.**
